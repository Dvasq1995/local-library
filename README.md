# local-library
Library app that allows users to see information and statistics for authors, books, and book genres.
The user can select from different tabs to find out information about users and books. This can be adapted to include other information as opposed to just book related information since it can serve as a basic way of storing information.
This project was good at getting me to have a good understanding at Array methods, even then I intend to change this project to use React.js and also expand its capabilities, perhaps to allow the user to setup their own data to store.
Written with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
